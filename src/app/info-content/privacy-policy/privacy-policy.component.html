        <p>I have written this privacy policy (version 10.01.2025-322929322) to explain to you, in accordance with the
            requirements of the
            <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=322929322#d1e2269-1-1"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable
            national
            laws, what personal data (short data) we as the responsible party &#8211; and the processors we commission
            (e.g., providers) &#8211; process, will process in the future, and what lawful options you have. The terms
            used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br />
            <strong>In short:</strong> I inform you comprehensively about the data I process about you.
        </p>
        <p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. This privacy policy, however, aims
            to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible.
            Where it is conducive to transparency, technical <strong>terms are explained in a reader-friendly
                manner</strong>, links to further information are provided, and <strong>graphics</strong> are used. I
            inform you in clear and simple
            language that we only process personal data within the scope of our business activities if there is a
            corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if one provides the shortest, unclear, and
            legally-technical explanations, as is often standard on the internet when it comes to data protection.
            I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative, and perhaps there is one or another
            piece of information that you did not know yet.<br />
            If you still have questions, we ask you to contact the responsible office mentioned below or in the legal
            notice, follow the provided links, and view further information on third-party sites.
            My contact details can also be found in the legal notice.</p>
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data
            processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the
            meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address, and postal address of a person. The
            processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or
            offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
            <li>social media presences and email communication</li>
            <li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas where personal data is processed in the
            company through the mentioned channels. Should we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these
            channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.
        </p>
        <h2 id="legal-basis">Legal Basis</h2>
        <p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information about the legal principles and
            regulations, i.e., the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which allow us to process
            personal data.<br />
            As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF
            THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. You can, of course, read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on
            EUR-Lex, the access to EU law, at <a
                href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a
                specific purpose. An example would be the storage of your entered data in a contact form.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Contract</strong> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): To fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations
                with you, we process your data. For example, if we enter into a purchase contract with you, we need
                personal information in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Obligation</strong> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we
                process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to retain invoices for accounting purposes. These
                usually contain personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that
                do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we
                need to process certain data to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This
                processing is therefore a legitimate interest.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other conditions such as the perception of tasks in the public interest and the exercise of official
            authority, as well as the protection of vital interests, generally do not apply to us. If such a legal basis
            should be relevant, it will be indicated at the appropriate place.</p>
        <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>Austria</strong>, this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to
                the Processing of Personal Data (<strong>Data Protection Act</strong>), abbreviated as
                <strong>DSG</strong>.</li>
            <li>In <strong>Germany</strong>, the <strong>Federal Data Protection Act</strong>, abbreviated as
                <strong>BDSG</strong>, applies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If further regional or national laws apply, we will inform you in the following sections.</p>
        <h2 id="contact-details-responsible">Contact Details of the Responsible Person</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about data protection or the processing of personal data, you will find the contact
            details of the responsible person according to Article 4 Paragraph 7 of the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR) below:<br />

        </p>
        <h2 id="storage-duration">Storage Duration</h2>
        <p>As a general criterion, we store personal data only as long as it is absolutely necessary to provide our
            services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for data processing no
            longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to retain certain data even after the original purpose
            has ceased to exist, for example, for accounting purposes.</p>
        <p>If you request the deletion of your data or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted
            as quickly as possible, provided there is no obligation to retain it.</p>
        <p>We will inform you about the specific duration of the respective data processing further below, provided we
            have additional information on this.</p>

        <h2 id="rights-gdpr">Rights according to the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
        <p>According to Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, we inform you about the following rights you have to ensure fair
            and transparent processing of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have the right to know whether we process data about you. If
                this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to learn the following
                information:
                <ul>
                    <li>the purpose for which we process the data;</li>
                    <li>the categories, i.e., the types of data that are processed;</li>
                    <li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be
                        guaranteed;</li>
                    <li>how long the data will be stored;</li>
                    <li>the existence of the right to rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing and the right
                        to object to processing;</li>
                    <li>that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be
                        found below);</li>
                    <li>the origin of the data, if we did not collect it from you;</li>
                    <li>whether profiling is carried out, i.e., whether data is automatically evaluated to create a
                        personal profile of you.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to rectification of the data, which means that
                we must correct data if you find errors.</li>
            <li>According to Article 17 of the GDPR, you have the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), which
                means that you may request the deletion of your data.</li>
            <li>According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing, which means that we may
                only store the data but not use it further.</li>
            <li>According to Article 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we must
                provide you with your data in a common format upon request.</li>
            <li>According to Article 21 of the GDPR, you have the right to object, which, if enforced, will result in a
                change in processing.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of
                        official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the processing.
                        We will then review as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.
                    </li>
                    <li>If data is used for direct marketing, you can object to this type of data processing at any
                        time. We may no longer use your data for direct marketing thereafter.</li>
                    <li>If data is used for profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We
                        may no longer use your data for profiling thereafter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>According to Article 22 of the GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely
                on automated processing (e.g., profiling).</li>
            <li>According to Article 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means that you can
                complain to a data protection authority at any time if you believe that the processing of personal data
                violates the GDPR.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>In short:</strong> You have rights – do not hesitate to contact the responsible office listed above!
        </p>
        <p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights
            have been violated in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In Austria,
            this is the Data Protection Authority, whose website you can find at <a
                href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=322929322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>.
            In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact
            the <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal
                Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>. For our company, the following
            local data protection authority is responsible:</p>
        <h2 id="">Bavarian Data Protection Authority</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>State Commissioner for Data Protection:</strong> Prof. Dr. Thomas Petri<br />

        </p>
        <h2 id="data-processing-security">Data Processing Security</h2>
        <p>To protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Where possible, we
            encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. This makes it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer
            personal information from our data within our capabilities.</p>
        <p>Article 25 of the GDPR refers to "data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly
            default settings," meaning that security is always considered and appropriate measures are taken in both
            software (e.g., forms) and hardware (e.g., access to the server room). Below, we will go into specific
            measures if necessary.</p>
        <h2 id="">TLS Encryption with HTTPS</h2>
        <p>TLS, encryption, and HTTPS sound very technical and they are. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            Secure) to securely transmit data over the internet.<br />
            This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured – no one
            can "listen in."</p>
        <p>We have thus introduced an additional security layer and fulfill data protection through technology design
            (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=322929322"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25(1) GDPR</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an
            encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the internet, we can ensure the protection of
            confidential data.<br />
            You can recognize the use of this data transmission security by the small lock symbol at the top left in the
            browser, to the left of the internet address (e.g., examplepage.de) and the use of the scheme https (instead
            of http) as part of our internet address.<br />
            If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend searching for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure

        <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
            In the following, we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the
            following privacy policy.</p>
        <p>Whenever you browse the internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers are, for example, Chrome, Safari,
            Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These
            files are called cookies.</p>
        <p>One thing is undeniable: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More
            precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other applications. HTTP cookies are
            small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically placed in
            the cookie folder, which is like the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When
            defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>
        <p>Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site
            again, your browser sends the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to the cookies, our
            website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its
            own file, in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
        <p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server.
            The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie from the server, which the browser uses again when
            another page is requested.</p>
        <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
            site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g., Google Analytics). Each cookie is
            individually evaluated, as each cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies
            from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans, or
            other "malware." Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>
        <p>For example, cookie data can look like this:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> _ga<br />
            <strong>Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152322929322-9<br />
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Distinguishing website visitors<br />
            <strong>Expiration date:</strong> after 2 years
        </p>
        <p>These minimum sizes should be supported by a browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
            <li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
            <li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What types of cookies are there?</h3>
        <p>The specific cookies we use depend on the services used and will be clarified in the following sections of
            the privacy policy. At this point, we would like to briefly explain the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
        <p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Essential Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies
            are needed when a user puts a product in the shopping cart, continues browsing on other pages, and later
            goes to the checkout. Through these cookies, the shopping cart is not deleted even if the user closes their
            browser window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Functional Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error
            messages. Additionally, these cookies measure the loading time and behavior of the website in different
            browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Targeted Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies ensure a better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes, or form
            data are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Advertising Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They are used to deliver personalized advertising
            to the user. This can be very useful, but also very annoying.
        </p>
        <p>Usually, you are asked when you first visit a website which types of cookies you want to allow. And of
            course, this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not shy away from technical documentation, we recommend <a
                href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>,
            the Request for Comments by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) named "HTTP State Management
            Mechanism."</p>
        <h3>Purpose of processing through cookies</h3>
        <p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. More details can be found below or from the software
            manufacturer that sets the cookie.</p>
        <h3>What data is processed?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which
            data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or stored data within the framework of
            this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Storage duration of cookies</h3>
        <p>The storage duration depends on the respective cookie and will be specified further below. Some cookies are
            deleted after less than an hour, while others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p>
        <p>You also have an influence on the storage duration. You can manually delete all cookies at any time via your
            browser (see also below "Right to object"). Furthermore, cookies based on consent will be deleted at the
            latest after you withdraw your consent, whereby the legality of the storage remains unaffected until then.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to object – how can I delete cookies?</h3>
        <p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the
            cookies come from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate, or only partially allow cookies. For
            example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
        <p>If you want to find out which cookies are stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie
            settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p>

        </p>
        <p>If you generally do not want to have cookies, you can set your browser to always inform you when a cookie is
            to be set. This way, you can decide for each individual cookie whether you want to allow it or not. The
            procedure varies depending on the browser. It is best to search for the instructions on Google with the
            search term "delete cookies Chrome" or "disable cookies Chrome" in the case of a Chrome browser.</p>
        <h3>Legal basis</h3>
        <p>Since 2009, there have been the so-called "cookie guidelines." These state that storing cookies requires your
            consent (Article 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). However, there are very different reactions to these guidelines
            within the EU countries. In Austria, this directive was implemented in Section 165 para. 3 of the
            Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie guidelines were not implemented as national law.
            Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 para. 3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG), which has
            been replaced by the Digital Services Act (DSA) since May 2024.</p>
        <p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent is given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6
            para. 1 lit. f GDPR), which are mostly of an economic nature. We want to provide visitors to the website
            with a pleasant user experience, and certain cookies are often absolutely necessary for this.</p>
        <p>If non-essential cookies are used, this only happens with your consent. The legal basis is then Art. 6 para.
            1 lit. a GDPR.</p>
        <p>In the following sections, you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies, provided that the
            software used employs cookies.</p>

        <h3>What is Webhosting?</h3>
        <p>When you visit websites today, certain information – including personal data – is automatically created and
            stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly and with justification as
            possible. By website, we mean the entirety of all web pages on a domain, i.e., everything from the homepage
            to the very last subpage (like this one). By domain, we mean, for example, example.com or sampleexample.com.
        </p>
        <p>When you want to view a website on a computer, tablet, or smartphone, you use a program called a web browser.
            You probably know some web browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple
            Safari. We simply call them browsers or web browsers.</p>
        <p>To display the website, the browser must connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the
            web server. Operating a web server is a complicated and costly task, which is why it is usually handled by
            professional providers, the hosts. They offer web hosting and ensure reliable and error-free storage of
            website data. A lot of technical terms, but please stay with us, it gets better!</p>
        <p>When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone) connects and during data
            transmission to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. On the one hand, your computer
            stores data, and on the other hand, the web server must store data for a while to ensure proper operation.
        </p>
        <p>A picture is worth a thousand words, so the following graphic illustrates the interaction between the
            browser, the internet, and the hosting provider.</p>
        <h3>Why do we process personal data?</h3>
        <p>The purposes of data processing are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Professional hosting of the website and securing the operation</li>
            <li>Maintaining operational and IT security</li>
            <li>Anonymous evaluation of access behavior to improve our offer and, if necessary, for law enforcement or
                claims enforcement</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What data is processed?</h3>
        <p>Even while you are visiting our website right now, our web server, which is the computer on which this
            website is stored, usually automatically saves data such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the complete internet address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
            <li>browser and browser version (e.g., Chrome 87)</li>
            <li>the operating system used (e.g., Windows 10)</li>
            <li>the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g., <a
                    href="https://www.example-source-site.com/where-i-came-from/" target="_blank"
                    rel="follow noopener">https://www.example-source-site.com/where-i-came-from/</a>)</li>
            <li>the hostname and IP address of the device from which access is made (e.g., COMPUTERNAME and
                194.23.43.121)</li>
            <li>date and time</li>
            <li>in files, the so-called web server log files</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How long is data stored?</h3>
        <p>As a rule, the above-mentioned data is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass on
            this data, but we cannot exclude that this data may be viewed by authorities in the event of unlawful
            behavior.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>In short:</strong> Your visit is logged by our provider (the company that runs our website on
            special computers (servers)), but we do not pass on your data without consent!
        </p>
        <h3>Legal basis</h3>
        <p>The legality of processing personal data in the context of web hosting results from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
            GDPR (legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting by a provider is necessary to present the
            company securely and user-friendly on the internet and to be able to pursue attacks and claims if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>There is usually a contract for order processing according to Art. 28 f. GDPR between us and the hosting
            provider, which ensures compliance with data protection and guarantees data security.</p>
        <p>All texts are protected by copyright.</p>

            <strong>Kurz gesagt:</strong> Ich informieren Sie umfassend über Daten, die ich über Sie verarbeite.
        </p>
        <p>Datenschutzerklärungen klingen für gewöhnlich sehr technisch und verwenden juristische Fachbegriffe. Diese

            Soweit es der Transparenz förderlich ist, werden technische <strong>Begriffe leserfreundlich

            eine
            entsprechende gesetzliche Grundlage gegeben ist. Das ist sicher nicht möglich, wenn man möglichst knappe,
            unklare und juristisch-technische Erklärungen abgibt, so wie sie im Internet oft Standard sind, wenn es um
            Datenschutz geht.
            Ich hoffe, Sie finden die folgenden Erläuterungen interessant und informativ und vielleicht ist die eine
            oder andere Information dabei, die Sie noch nicht kannten.<br />

            Sollten wir
            außerhalb dieser Kanäle mit Ihnen in Rechtsbeziehungen eintreten, werden wir Sie gegebenenfalls gesondert
            informieren.
        </p>
        <h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen">Rechtsgrundlagen</h2>
        <p>In der folgenden Datenschutzerklärung geben wir Ihnen transparente Informationen zu den rechtlichen
            Grundsätzen und Vorschriften, also den Rechtsgrundlagen der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, die uns
            ermöglichen,
            personenbezogene Daten zu verarbeiten.<br />
            Was das EU-Recht betrifft, beziehen wir uns auf die VERORDNUNG (EU) 2016/679 DES EUROPÄISCHEN PARLAMENTS UND
            DES RATES vom 27. April 2016. Diese Datenschutz-Grundverordnung der EU können Sie selbstverständlich online
            auf
            EUR-Lex, dem Zugang zum EU-Recht, unter <a

            nachlesen.</p>
        <p>Ich verarbeite Ihre Daten nur, wenn mindestens eine der folgenden Bedingungen zutrifft:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Einwilligung</strong> (Artikel 6 Absatz 1 lit. a DSGVO): Sie haben uns Ihre
                Einwilligung gegeben, Daten zu einem bestimmten Zweck zu verarbeiten. Ein Beispiel wäre die Speicherung
                Ihrer eingegebenen Daten eines Kontaktformulars.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vertrag</strong> (Artikel 6 Absatz 1 lit. b DSGVO): Um einen Vertrag
                oder vorvertragliche Verpflichtungen mit Ihnen zu erfüllen, verarbeiten wir Ihre Daten. Wenn wir zum
                Beispiel
                einen Kaufvertrag mit Ihnen abschließen, benötigen wir vorab personenbezogene Informationen.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rechtliche Verpflichtung</strong> (Artikel 6 Absatz 1 lit. c DSGVO):
                Wenn wir einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung unterliegen, verarbeiten wir Ihre Daten. Zum Beispiel sind wir
                gesetzlich verpflichtet Rechnungen für die Buchhaltung aufzuheben. Diese enthalten in der Regel
                personenbezogene
                Daten.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Berechtigte Interessen</strong> (Artikel 6 Absatz 1 lit. f DSGVO): Im
                Falle berechtigter Interessen, die Ihre Grundrechte nicht einschränken, behalten wir uns die
                Verarbeitung
                personenbezogener Daten vor. Wir müssen zum Beispiel gewisse Daten verarbeiten, um unsere Website sicher
                und wirtschaftlich effizient betreiben zu können. Diese Verarbeitung ist somit ein berechtigtes
                Interesse.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Weitere Bedingungen wie die Wahrnehmung von Aufnahmen im öffentlichen Interesse und Ausübung öffentlicher
            Gewalt sowie dem Schutz lebenswichtiger Interessen treten bei uns in der Regel nicht auf. Soweit eine solche
            Rechtsgrundlage doch einschlägig sein sollte, wird diese an der entsprechenden Stelle ausgewiesen.</p>
        <p>Zusätzlich zu der EU-Verordnung gelten auch noch nationale Gesetze:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>Österreich</strong> ist dies das
                Bundesgesetz
                zum Schutz natürlicher Personen bei der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten
                (<strong>Datenschutzgesetz</strong>),
                kurz <strong>DSG</strong>.</li>
            <li>In <strong>Deutschland</strong> gilt das <strong>Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</strong>, kurz

        <p>Dass wir personenbezogene Daten nur so lange speichern, wie es für die Bereitstellung unserer
            Dienstleistungen und
            Produkte unbedingt notwendig ist, gilt als generelles Kriterium bei uns. Das bedeutet, dass wir
            personenbezogene Daten löschen, sobald der Grund für die Datenverarbeitung nicht mehr vorhanden ist. In
            einigen Fällen sind
            wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, bestimmte Daten auch nach Wegfall des ursprüngliches Zwecks zu speichern,
            zum
            Beispiel zu Zwecken der Buchführung.</p>
        <p>Sollten Sie die Löschung Ihrer Daten wünschen oder die Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung widerrufen, werden
            die Daten so rasch wie möglich und soweit keine Pflicht zur Speicherung besteht, gelöscht.</p>
        <p>Über die konkrete Dauer der jeweiligen Datenverarbeitung informieren wir Sie weiter unten, sofern wir weitere

            <li>Sie haben laut Artikel 21 DSGVO ein Widerspruchsrecht, welches nach
                Durchsetzung
                eine
                Änderung der Verarbeitung mit sich bringt.

        <h2 id="sicherheit-datenverarbeitung">Sicherheit der Datenverarbeitung</h2>
        <p>Um personenbezogene Daten zu schützen, haben wir sowohl technische als auch organisatorische Maßnahmen
            umgesetzt.
            Wo
            es uns möglich ist, verschlüsseln oder pseudonymisieren wir personenbezogene Daten. Dadurch machen wir es im
            Rahmen
            unserer Möglichkeiten so schwer wie möglich, dass Dritte aus unseren Daten auf persönliche Informationen
            schließen
            können.</p>
        <p>Art. 25 DSGVO spricht hier von &#8220;Datenschutz durch Technikgestaltung und durch datenschutzfreundliche
            Voreinstellungen&#8221; und meint damit, dass man sowohl bei Software (z. B. Formularen) also auch Hardware
            (z.
            B.
            Zugang zum Serverraum) immer an Sicherheit denkt und entsprechende Maßnahmen setzt. Im Folgenden gehen wir,
            falls
            erforderlich, noch auf konkrete Maßnahmen ein.</p>
        <h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https">TLS-Verschlüsselung mit https</h2>
        <p>TLS, Verschlüsselung und https klingen sehr technisch und sind es auch. Wir verwenden HTTPS (das Hypertext
            Transfer
            Protocol Secure steht für „sicheres Hypertext-Übertragungsprotokoll“), um Daten abhörsicher im Internet zu
            übertragen.<br />
            Das bedeutet, dass die komplette Übertragung aller Daten von Ihrem Browser zu unserem Webserver abgesichert
            ist
            &#8211; niemand kann &#8220;mithören&#8221;.</p>
        <p>Damit haben wir eine zusätzliche Sicherheitsschicht eingeführt und erfüllen den Datenschutz durch
            Technikgestaltung
            (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=322929322"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artikel 25 Absatz 1 DSGVO</a>). Durch den Einsatz von TLS (Transport
            Layer
            Security), einem Verschlüsselungsprotokoll zur sicheren Datenübertragung im Internet, können wir den Schutz
            vertraulicher Daten sicherstellen.<br />
            Sie erkennen die Benutzung dieser Absicherung der Datenübertragung am kleinen Schlosssymbol links
            oben im Browser, links von der Internetadresse (z. B. beispielseite.de) und der Verwendung des Schemas https
            (anstatt http) als Teil unserer Internetadresse.<br />
            Wenn Sie mehr zum Thema Verschlüsselung wissen möchten, empfehlen wir die Google Suche nach &#8220;Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol Secure wiki&#8221; um gute Links zu weiterführenden Informationen zu erhalten.</p>

        <h3>Was sind Cookies?</h3>
        <p>Unsere Website verwendet HTTP-Cookies, um nutzerspezifische Daten zu speichern.<br />
            Im Folgenden erklären wir, was Cookies sind und warum Sie genutzt werden, damit Sie die folgende
            Datenschutzerklärung besser verstehen.</p>
        <p>Immer wenn Sie durch das Internet surfen, verwenden Sie einen Browser. Bekannte Browser sind beispielsweise
            Chrome,
            Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer und Microsoft Edge. Die meisten Websites speichern kleine Text-Dateien in
            Ihrem
            Browser. Diese Dateien nennt man Cookies.</p>
        <p>Eines ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen: Cookies sind echt nützliche Helferlein. Fast alle Websites verwenden
            Cookies.
            Genauer gesprochen sind es HTTP-Cookies, da es auch noch andere Cookies für andere Anwendungsbereiche gibt.
            HTTP-Cookies sind kleine Dateien, die von unserer Website auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden. Diese
            Cookie-Dateien werden automatisch im Cookie-Ordner, quasi dem &#8220;Hirn&#8221; Ihres Browsers,
            untergebracht.
            Ein
            Cookie besteht aus einem Namen und einem Wert. Bei der Definition eines Cookies müssen zusätzlich ein oder
            mehrere
            Attribute angegeben werden.</p>
        <p>Cookies speichern gewisse Nutzerdaten von Ihnen, wie beispielsweise Sprache oder persönliche
            Seiteneinstellungen.
            Wenn Sie unsere Seite wieder aufrufen, übermittelt Ihr Browser die „userbezogenen“ Informationen an unsere
            Seite
            zurück. Dank der Cookies weiß unsere Website, wer Sie sind und bietet Ihnen die Einstellung, die Sie gewohnt
            sind.
            In einigen Browsern hat jedes Cookie eine eigene Datei, in anderen wie beispielsweise Firefox sind alle
            Cookies
            in
            einer einzigen Datei gespeichert.</p>
        <p>Die folgende Grafik zeigt eine mögliche Interaktion zwischen einem Webbrowser wie z. B. Chrome und dem
            Webserver.
            Dabei fordert der Webbrowser eine Website an und erhält vom Server ein Cookie zurück, welches der Browser
            erneut
            verwendet, sobald eine andere Seite angefordert wird.</p>
        <p>Es gibt sowohl Erstanbieter Cookies als auch Drittanbieter-Cookies. Erstanbieter-Cookies werden direkt von
            unserer
            Seite erstellt, Drittanbieter-Cookies werden von Partner-Websites (z.B. Google Analytics) erstellt. Jedes
            Cookie
            ist
            individuell zu bewerten, da jedes Cookie andere Daten speichert. Auch die Ablaufzeit eines Cookies variiert
            von
            ein
            paar Minuten bis hin zu ein paar Jahren. Cookies sind keine Software-Programme und enthalten keine Viren,
            Trojaner
            oder andere „Schädlinge“. Cookies können auch nicht auf Informationen Ihres PCs zugreifen.</p>
        <p>So können zum Beispiel Cookie-Daten aussehen:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> _ga<br />
            <strong>Wert:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152322929322-9<br />
            <strong>Verwendungszweck:</strong> Unterscheidung der Websitebesucher<br />
            <strong>Ablaufdatum:</strong> nach 2 Jahren
        </p>
        <p>Diese Mindestgrößen sollte ein Browser unterstützen können:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mindestens 4096 Bytes pro Cookie</li>
            <li>Mindestens 50 Cookies pro Domain</li>
            <li>Mindestens 3000 Cookies insgesamt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Welche Arten von Cookies gibt es?</h3>
        <p>Die Frage welche Cookies wir im Speziellen verwenden, hängt von den verwendeten Diensten ab und wird in den
            folgenden
            Abschnitten der Datenschutzerklärung geklärt. An dieser Stelle möchten wir kurz auf die verschiedenen Arten
            von
            HTTP-Cookies eingehen.</p>
        <p>Man kann 4 Arten von Cookies unterscheiden:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Unerlässliche Cookies<br />
            </strong>Diese Cookies sind nötig, um grundlegende Funktionen der Website sicherzustellen. Zum Beispiel
            braucht
            es
            diese Cookies, wenn ein User ein Produkt in den Warenkorb legt, dann auf anderen Seiten weitersurft und
            später
            erst
            zur Kasse geht. Durch diese Cookies wird der Warenkorb nicht gelöscht, selbst wenn der User sein
            Browserfenster
            schließt.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Zweckmäßige Cookies<br />
            </strong>Diese Cookies sammeln Infos über das Userverhalten und ob der User etwaige Fehlermeldungen bekommt.
            Zudem
            werden mithilfe dieser Cookies auch die Ladezeit und das Verhalten der Website bei verschiedenen Browsern
            gemessen.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Zielorientierte Cookies<br />
            </strong>Diese Cookies sorgen für eine bessere Nutzerfreundlichkeit. Beispielsweise werden eingegebene
            Standorte,
            Schriftgrößen oder Formulardaten gespeichert.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Werbe-Cookies<br />
            </strong>Diese Cookies werden auch Targeting-Cookies genannt. Sie dienen dazu dem User individuell
            angepasste
            Werbung zu liefern. Das kann sehr praktisch, aber auch sehr nervig sein.
        </p>
        <p>Üblicherweise werden Sie beim erstmaligen Besuch einer Website gefragt, welche dieser Cookiearten Sie
            zulassen
            möchten. Und natürlich wird diese Entscheidung auch in einem Cookie gespeichert.</p>
        <p>Wenn Sie mehr über Cookies wissen möchten und technische Dokumentationen nicht scheuen, empfehlen wir <a
                href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, dem
            Request for Comments der Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) namens &#8220;HTTP State Management
            Mechanism&#8221;.</p>
        <h3>Zweck der Verarbeitung über Cookies</h3>
        <p>Der Zweck ist letztendlich abhängig vom jeweiligen Cookie. Mehr Details dazu finden Sie weiter unten bzw.
            beim
            Hersteller der Software, die das Cookie setzt.</p>
        <h3>Welche Daten werden verarbeitet?</h3>
        <p>Cookies sind kleine Gehilfen für eine viele verschiedene Aufgaben. Welche Daten in Cookies gespeichert
            werden,
            kann
            man leider nicht verallgemeinern, aber wir werden Sie im Rahmen der folgenden Datenschutzerklärung über die
            verarbeiteten bzw. gespeicherten Daten informieren.</p>
        <h3>Speicherdauer von Cookies</h3>
        <p>Die Speicherdauer hängt vom jeweiligen Cookie ab und wird weiter unter präzisiert. Manche Cookies werden nach
            weniger
            als einer Stunde gelöscht, andere können mehrere Jahre auf einem Computer gespeichert bleiben.</p>
        <p>Sie haben außerdem selbst Einfluss auf die Speicherdauer. Sie können über ihren Browser sämtliche Cookies
            jederzeit
            manuell löschen (siehe auch unten &#8220;Widerspruchsrecht&#8221;). Ferner werden Cookies, die auf einer
            Einwilligung beruhen, spätestens nach Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung gelöscht, wobei die Rechtmäßigkeit der
            Speicherung
            bis dahin unberührt bleibt.</p>
        <h3>Widerspruchsrecht &#8211; wie kann ich Cookies löschen?</h3>
        <p>Wie und ob Sie Cookies verwenden wollen, entscheiden Sie selbst. Unabhängig von welchem Service oder welcher
            Website
            die Cookies stammen, haben Sie immer die Möglichkeit Cookies zu löschen, zu deaktivieren oder nur teilweise
            zuzulassen. Zum Beispiel können Sie Cookies von Drittanbietern blockieren, aber alle anderen Cookies
            zulassen.
        </p>
        <p>Wenn Sie feststellen möchten, welche Cookies in Ihrem Browser gespeichert wurden, wenn Sie
            Cookie-Einstellungen
            ändern oder löschen wollen, können Sie dies in Ihren Browser-Einstellungen finden:</p>

        <p>Falls Sie grundsätzlich keine Cookies haben wollen, können Sie Ihren Browser so einrichten, dass er Sie immer
            informiert, wenn ein Cookie gesetzt werden soll. So können Sie bei jedem einzelnen Cookie entscheiden, ob
            Sie
            das
            Cookie erlauben oder nicht. Die Vorgangsweise ist je nach Browser verschieden. Am besten Sie suchen die
            Anleitung in
            Google mit dem Suchbegriff “Cookies löschen Chrome” oder &#8220;Cookies deaktivieren Chrome&#8221; im Falle
            eines
            Chrome Browsers.</p>
        <h3>Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
        <p>Seit 2009 gibt es die sogenannten „Cookie-Richtlinien“. Darin ist festgehalten, dass das Speichern von
            Cookies
            eine
            <strong>Einwilligung</strong> (Artikel 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) von Ihnen verlangt.
            Innerhalb der EU-Länder gibt es allerdings noch sehr unterschiedliche Reaktionen auf diese Richtlinien. In
            Österreich erfolgte aber die Umsetzung dieser Richtlinie in § 165 Abs. 3 des Telekommunikationsgesetzes
            (2021).
            In
            Deutschland wurden die Cookie-Richtlinien nicht als nationales Recht umgesetzt. Stattdessen erfolgte die
            Umsetzung
            dieser Richtlinie weitgehend in § 15 Abs. 3 des Telemediengesetzes (TMG), welches seit Mai 2024 durch das
            Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz (DDG) ersetzt wurde.
        </p>
        <p>Für unbedingt notwendige Cookies, auch soweit keine Einwilligung vorliegt, bestehen <strong>berechtigte
                Interessen</strong> (Artikel 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO), die in den
            meisten
            Fällen wirtschaftlicher Natur sind. Wir möchten den Besuchern der Website eine angenehme Benutzererfahrung
            bescheren
            und dafür sind bestimmte Cookies oft unbedingt notwendig.</p>
        <p>Soweit nicht unbedingt erforderliche Cookies zum Einsatz kommen, geschieht dies nur im Falle Ihrer
            Einwilligung.
            Rechtsgrundlage ist insoweit Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO.</p>
        <p>In den folgenden Abschnitten werden Sie genauer über den Einsatz von Cookies informiert, sofern eingesetzte
            Software
            Cookies verwendet.</p>

        <h3>Was ist Webhosting?</h3>
        <p>Wenn Sie heutzutage Websites besuchen, werden gewisse Informationen &#8211; auch personenbezogene Daten
            &#8211;
            automatisch erstellt und gespeichert, so auch auf dieser Website. Diese Daten sollten möglichst sparsam und
            nur
            mit
            Begründung verarbeitet werden. Mit Website meinen wir übrigens die Gesamtheit aller Webseiten auf einer
            Domain,
            d.h.
            alles von der Startseite (Homepage) bis hin zur aller letzten Unterseite (wie dieser hier). Mit Domain
            meinen
            wir
            zum Beispiel beispiel.de oder musterbeispiel.com.</p>
        <p>Wenn Sie eine Website auf einem Computer, Tablet oder Smartphone ansehen möchten, verwenden Sie dafür ein
            Programm,
            das sich Webbrowser nennt. Sie kennen vermutlich einige Webbrowser beim Namen: Google Chrome, Microsoft
            Edge,
            Mozilla Firefox und Apple Safari. Wir sagen kurz Browser oder Webbrowser dazu.</p>
        <p>Um die Website anzuzeigen, muss sich der Browser zu einem anderen Computer verbinden, wo der Code der Website
            gespeichert ist: dem Webserver. Der Betrieb eines Webservers ist eine komplizierte und aufwendige Aufgabe,
            weswegen
            dies in der Regel von professionellen Anbietern, den Providern, übernommen wird. Diese bieten Webhosting an
            und
            sorgen damit für eine verlässliche und fehlerfreie Speicherung der Daten von Websites. Eine ganze Menge
            Fachbegriffe, aber bitte bleiben Sie dran, es wird noch besser!</p>
        <p>Bei der Verbindungsaufnahme des Browsers auf Ihrem Computer (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet oder Smartphone) und
            während
            der
            Datenübertragung zu und vom Webserver kann es zu einer Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten kommen.
            Einerseits
            speichert Ihr Computer Daten, andererseits muss auch der Webserver Daten eine Zeit lang speichern, um einen
            ordentlichen Betrieb zu gewährleisten.</p>
        <p>Ein Bild sagt mehr als tausend Worte, daher zeigt folgende Grafik zur Veranschaulichung das Zusammenspiel
            zwischen
            Browser, dem Internet und dem Hosting-Provider.</p>
        <h3>Warum verarbeiten wir personenbezogene Daten?</h3>
        <p>Die Zwecke der Datenverarbeitung sind:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Professionelles Hosting der Website und Absicherung des Betriebs</li>
            <li>zur Aufrechterhaltung der Betriebs- und IT-Sicherheit</li>
            <li>Anonyme Auswertung des Zugriffsverhaltens zur Verbesserung unseres Angebots
                und
                ggf.
                zur Strafverfolgung bzw. Verfolgung von Ansprüchen</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Welche Daten werden verarbeitet?</h3>
        <p>Auch während Sie unsere Website jetzt gerade besuchen, speichert unser Webserver, das ist der Computer auf
            dem
            diese
            Webseite gespeichert ist, in der Regel automatisch Daten wie</p>
        <ul>
            <li>die komplette Internetadresse (URL) der aufgerufenen Webseite</li>
            <li>Browser und Browserversion (z. B. Chrome 87)</li>
            <li>das verwendete Betriebssystem (z. B. Windows 10)</li>

                    rel="follow noopener">https://www.beispielquellsite.de/vondabinichgekommen/</a>)

        <h3>Wie lange werden Daten gespeichert?</h3>
        <p>In der Regel werden die oben genannten Daten zwei Wochen gespeichert und danach automatisch gelöscht. Wir
            geben
            diese
            Daten nicht weiter, können jedoch nicht ausschließen, dass diese Daten beim Vorliegen von rechtswidrigem
            Verhalten
            von Behörden eingesehen werden.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Kurz gesagt:</strong> Ihr Besuch wird durch unseren Provider (Firma, die
            unsere
            Website auf speziellen Computern (Servern) laufen lässt), protokolliert, aber wir geben Ihre Daten nicht
            ohne
            Zustimmung weiter!
        </p>
        <h3>Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
        <p>Die Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten im Rahmen des Webhosting ergibt sich aus Art. 6
            Abs.
            1
            lit. f DSGVO (Wahrung der berechtigten Interessen), denn die Nutzung von professionellem Hosting bei einem
            Provider
            ist notwendig, um das Unternehmen im Internet sicher und nutzerfreundlich präsentieren und Angriffe und
            Forderungen
            hieraus gegebenenfalls verfolgen zu können.</p>
        <p>Zwischen uns und dem Hosting-Provider besteht in der Regel ein Vertrag über die Auftragsverarbeitung gemäß
            Art.
            28 f.
            DSGVO, der die Einhaltung von Datenschutz gewährleistet und Datensicherheit garantiert.</p>
